# DeskPlatformRpt

Hello, Code Reviewer(s)! I used `bundler` to generate the scaffold for this project for convenience, but haven't actually installed it as a gem. Just a heads up--trying to install it as a gem might not work.

## Getting Started
1. run `bundle install` to install the dependencies
2. go to [twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/reference/get/statuses/sample) and use the Oauth Signature Generator to get your credentials to consume the twitter stream.

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
